# NEW RESEARCH — Project-Specific Research Tasks

> **Generated by `newjp` command**
> This file lists features in your project that need extra research because they go beyond standard Flutter + PocketBase capabilities.

---

## How This Works

1. User runs `newjp` after `initjp`
2. Manager AI scans `PROJECT_REPORT.md` and `REQUIREMENTS.md`
3. Identifies features that need **alternative approaches** in PocketBase/Flutter
4. Writes research tasks below with:
   - **What**: The feature needed
   - **Why Research**: Why standard approach won't work
   - **Research Topics**: What to investigate
   - **Possible Solutions**: Known alternatives
5. User/Agent researches each topic
6. Findings are added under each task
7. Manager AI uses findings when generating prompts via `startjp`/`nextjp`
